# About Me

<img src="{{ "/assets/images/graduation.jpg" | absolute_url }}"
width="50%" style="margin-right: 20px;" align="left">

I have a Ph.D. degree from the [Electrical Engineering department of Indian Institute of Technology](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/), Chennai, with a Best Interdisciplinary Thesis [1] award at the institute level.

With over a decade of experience in R&D and two years in Product Development, I specialize in biomedical technologies within the cardiovascular space. I have expertise in several fronts, including advanced signal processing, industrial and biomedical instrumentation, vascular biomechanics, vascular aging pathways, and state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging technologies. 
My passion lies in transforming healthcare accessibility by building affordable solutions and advocating for preventive and primordial care. This commitment is underscored by over [30+ patents filed](/portfolio/), demonstrating tangible efforts to drive positive change in the healthcare landscape. I am also passionate about scientific communication, particularly the art of scientific writing. It is demonstrated by my extensive publication record of over [70+ high impact journals and peer-reviewed conference articles](/portfolio/) during a five years span of Ph.D.

Currently, I am on an exploratory journey to harness the potential of AI capabilities for developing preventive and personalized strategies to mitigate the risk of CVDs.
I thrive on continuous learning and embrace diverse experiences without hesitation. This allows me to excel as an architect, innovator, designer, and mentor. Curiosity led me to regulatory affairs as well, where I managed compliance for a [portable ultrafast-ultrasound system](https://artsens.tech/), completing documentation needed for FDA 510(k) and CDSCO submissions within a year.
