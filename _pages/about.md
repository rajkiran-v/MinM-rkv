## **Current Focus**
From 2023-2024, I have been leading the product development of [ARTSENS® Plus](https://artsens.tech/), an affordable, image-free ultrasound technology for comprehensive vascular health assessment. This innovative device, a key contribution of my Ph.D. thesis, is the only solution capable of measuring local carotid artery stiffness, aortic pulse wave velocity, central blood pressure, and brachial blood pressure in a single test.

In addition to product development, I have been driving translational research within the **Cardiovascular Science and Technology** cluster of our R&D center. My work also extends to **regulatory affairs**, where I successfully managed compliance of ARTSENS® Plus, completing the needed documentation for **FDA 510(k)** and **CDSCO submissions** within a year.

Currently, I am on an exploratory journey to harness the potential of **AI-driven preventive and personalized strategies** to mitigate the risk of CVDs.
